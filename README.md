<h1 style="text-align: center;"> What is BDD?</h1>

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology popularized by Dan North in the mid-2000s as an extension of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with a focus on collaboration and communication between developers, testers, and business stakeholders.

Key Points:
 - **Focus on Behavior:** BDD emphasizes the behaviors and outcomes of the software from the end user's perspective.
 - **Common Language:** Uses a common language to describe behaviors, typically structured in Given-When-Then scenarios.
 - **Collaboration:** Encourages collaboration between technical and non-technical team members to ensure the software meets business requirements.

BDD Workflow:
1. Discovery
> Collaboratively discover and define user stories and scenarios with all stakeholders.
2. Formulation
Translate user stories into concrete, executable scenarios using the Given-When-Then format.
3. Automation
> Implement automated tests for the scenarios using a BDD framework (e.g., Behave for Python).
4. Execution
> Run automated tests to verify the application behaves as expected.
5. Review
> Regularly review and update scenarios to ensure they reflect the current state of the application.

<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Gherkin</h1>

Gherkin is a domain-specific language used for writing human-readable descriptions of software behaviors without detailing how that functionality is implemented. It is a pivotal part of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), providing a way to describe software's expected behaviors in a clear and understandable manner for all stakeholders, including non-technical team members.

Key Characteristics:
1. Structured Syntax:
   *Gherkin follows a specific syntax that uses keywords such as Feature, Scenario, Given, When, Then, And, and But to structure the descriptions.*
2. Executable Documentation:
   *Gherkin scenarios are written in plain text and can be executed as tests by BDD tools like Cucumber or Behave, serving both as documentation and automated tests.*
3. Readability:
   *The language is designed to be easy to read and understand, ensuring that everyone involved in the development process can comprehend the scenarios.*
4. Feature Files:
   *Gherkin scenarios are organized into feature files, typically with a .feature extension, which describe a particular feature of the application.*

Keywords in Gherkin:
 - **Feature:** Describes the feature being tested.
 - **Scenario:** Defines a specific situation or test case.
 - **Given:** Sets up the initial context or state.
 - **When:** Describes an action or event.
 - **Then:** Specifies the expected outcome.
 - **And:** Used to add additional steps in Given, When, or Then.
